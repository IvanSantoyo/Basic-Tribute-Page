                A Yale graduate who became a highly regarded minister in Connecticut and Massachusetts, Murray was born in Guilford, Connecticut, in 1840.
                The Smithsonian states he took his first recreational camping trip in the summer of 1864. His destination of choice and for many more to follow was the Adirondacks.
                Located in upstate New York, the Adirondack region is one of the most well-known camping grounds in the country today.
                Murray began writing about his camping excursions during the first few years of his camping excursions. His writings were informal, focused on the practical aspects of the trip, and unpretentious.
                As well as what to wear, how to get there, the places to see, the costs involved, and how to deal with the local wildlife...like lighting a tree stump on fire to fend off wolves!?
                His writings were merely "narrative exercises" he used for his own purposes.
                Ministers used these exercises as tools to improve their sermon writing skills. But his casual style became a major part of his popularity with readers.
                In 1869, Murray has accumulated years of Adirondack camping experience, a notebook full of narrative exercises, and a friend in the publishing business.
                Despite some initial reluctance from the publisher and from Murray himself, his writing is eventually considered.
                His book is titled Adventures in the Wilderness, and it becomes an instant success. The idea of camping-as-recreation has officially been established in America.
                The popularity of summer vacations in the Adirondacks continued to grow thanks to Murray's book.
                As per The Smithsonian, the Adirondacks had about 3,000 summer residents at the time Murray published his first book, in 1869.
